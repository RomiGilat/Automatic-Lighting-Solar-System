Tasks Completed this week
  Over the winter break/start of this week I spent countless hours correcting issues with my subsystem that were noted at the end of 403. Since then I have redesigned both the Buck Converter and the Inverter and reordered parts to successfully build operating parts. Additionally I have also been contributing to our Implementation checklist and narrowing down our idea for implementing and presenting.

Current Problems
  None

Tasks to be achieved until the next week
  Successfully solder all components onto the redesigned PCB boards.
  Ensure complete functionality with both Buck Converter and Inverter.
  Begin designing covers for Buck Converter and Inverter.
  Begin subsystem implementation.
